      'Most business owners choose their entity structure once, early on, without fully understanding what they are choosing. That initial decision — or non-decision, since many sole proprietors never made one at all — silently shapes everything that comes after: how income is taxed, whether personal assets are at risk, how you pay yourself, and what planning strategies remain available.',
      'There is no universally right answer. Each structure involves genuine trade-offs between tax efficiency, liability protection, administrative burden, and flexibility. What matters is understanding what you are currently operating under and whether it still fits where you are today.',

      { name: 'Multi-Member LLC', tax: 'Partnership taxation by default — each member receives a K-1 and pays SE tax on their allocable share', liability: 'Strong — personal assets protected; operating agreement governs relationships', complexity: 'Moderate — Form 1065 partnership return plus K-1s annually', qbi: 'Yes', bestFor: 'Multiple founders wanting flexible profit allocation and liability protection' },

The most persistent myth is that earning more can leave you worse off by "bumping into a higher bracket." This is not how marginal taxation works. The highest bracket rate applies only to income above the threshold — never to everything you earned.',

    concepts: [
      { term: 'Marginal vs. Effective Rate', def: 'Your marginal rate is the rate on your last dollar of income. Your effective rate is your total tax divided by total income. The marginal rate is always higher than the effective rate. Earning more never leaves you with less after tax.' },

It is calculated on ${(TAX_2026.se.seIncomeMultiplier * 100).toFixed(2)}% of net earnings (the multiplier accounts for the deductibility of the employer half). The Social Security portion applies only up to the wage base of $${TAX_2026.se.ssWageBase.toLocaleString()} in 2026. Medicare applies to all SE income, with an additional 0.9% above $${TAX_2026.se.addlMedicareThreshold.single.toLocaleString()} (single) or $${TAX_2026.se.addlMedicareThreshold.mfj.toLocaleString()} (MFJ).` },
      { term: 'The S-Corp Salary Split', def: 'An S-corporation owner must pay themselves a "reasonable compensation" salary — a W-2 wage — for services rendered. Profits above that salary can be taken as distributions, which are not subject to payroll taxes. This split is the central mechanism of the S-corp tax strategy. The IRS scrutinizes unreasonably low salaries; the goal is an arm\'s-length wage for the services provided, with excess profit as distribution.' },

Above those thresholds, the calculation becomes more complex and is limited by wages paid and the business's capital base. Certain service businesses (law, consulting, health, financial services) face stricter limitations. The deduction does not reduce SE tax — only income tax.` },
      { term: 'Estimated Quarterly Taxes', def: 'Business owners do not have an employer withholding taxes from a paycheck. Instead, the IRS requires estimated tax payments four times per year — typically due in April, June, September, and January. Missing these creates an underpayment penalty.

This is one of the most commonly missed and costly errors for new and growing business owners.' },

Beyond standard operating costs, owners frequently miss: Section 179 and bonus depreciation for equipment and certain property (immediate full deduction rather than multi-year depreciation); the home office deduction for dedicated business use space; vehicle expenses (actual cost or standard mileage); health insurance premiums for self-employed owners; and retirement plan contributions — the most powerful tax shelter most owners have access to.' },

Qualified Small Employer Health Reimbursement Arrangements (QSEHRA, for businesses with fewer than 50 employees) and Individual Coverage HRAs (ICHRA, available to any size employer) allow a business to reimburse employees tax-free for individual market health insurance premiums and medical expenses — without offering a group plan.

    overview: [
      'Most business owners think about life insurance as a personal matter — something to provide for their family. They rarely think about what the business itself would face if they died or became disabled. In many small businesses, the owner is the business: the key relationship holder, the technical expert, the person whose reputation brings in clients. The loss of that person is not only a personal tragedy; it is a business crisis that unfolds in real time while people are still grieving.',
      'There are three distinct insurance needs for the business owner that go beyond personal coverage: key-person insurance to protect the company itself, buy-sell funding insurance to handle the transition of ownership, and disability coverage that addresses the statistically most likely scenario — not death, but an inability to work.',
    ],
    concepts: [
      { term: 'Key-Person Life Insurance', def: 'The company purchases and owns a life insurance policy on a key owner, executive, or employee. The company pays the premiums (not deductible) and is the beneficiary of the death benefit. The purpose is to give the surviving business the capital to: replace the key person, service debt that depended on that person\'s income or guarantee, stabilize cash flow during a difficult transition period, and fund the cost of recruiting. The death benefit amount is typically calculated as a multiple of the key person\'s contribution to revenue or earnings, often 5-10 times annual revenue attributable to them.' },
      { term: 'Buy-Sell Agreements', def: 'A buy-sell agreement is the legal arrangement between co-owners that controls what happens to an owner\'s interest in the business if they die, become permanently disabled, divorce, go bankrupt, or simply want to leave. Without one, a deceased owner\'s heirs may become your new business partners — regardless of whether they have any interest in or capability to participate in the business. A properly funded buy-sell creates a clear exit at a predetermined or formula-determined price, funded by insurance so that the payment mechanism exists when needed.' },
      { term: 'Cross-Purchase vs. Entity Redemption', def: 'In a cross-purchase structure, each co-owner holds a policy on each other owner. At death, the surviving owners use the proceeds to purchase the deceased owner\'s interest from the estate. In an entity redemption structure, the company holds policies on each owner and uses the proceeds to redeem the deceased owner\'s interest. Each structure has different tax, basis, and administrative implications. A business attorney should design the structure appropriate to your ownership count, entity type, and estate planning goals.' },
      { term: 'Disability Buy-Sell Insurance', def: 'Disability is statistically more likely than death during working years, yet fewer business owners have disability-triggered buy-sell provisions. If an owner becomes permanently disabled, a disability buy-out policy provides the funding to trigger the same ownership transition that a death would — at a predetermined price, without forcing a fire sale or partnership deadlock.' },
      { term: 'Business Overhead Expense Insurance', def: 'If the owner is disabled and cannot work, who pays the lease, the salaries, and the utility bills? Business Overhead Expense (BOE) insurance covers the fixed operating expenses of the business during the owner\'s disability — typically for 12-24 months — giving the business time to adapt without defaulting on obligations or losing key staff.' },
      { term: 'Personal Disability Income Insurance', def: 'For an owner who draws income from the business, personal disability income coverage replaces a portion of their compensation if they cannot work. Disability policies owned personally (paid with after-tax dollars) produce tax-free benefits. Policies paid by the business are deductible but benefits become taxable. The personal ownership structure almost always produces better economics at claim time.' },
    ],
    keyTakeaways: [
      'If you have a business partner and no buy-sell agreement, you may be one unexpected event away from becoming co-owners with someone\'s spouse — someone who did not choose to be your partner and may not want the role.',
      'Key-person insurance is a business asset. The premiums are not deductible, but the death benefit comes in free of income tax (though potentially subject to corporate AMT in a C-corp). The net economic value is still substantially positive.',
      'Disability is the underinsured risk. You are more likely to be disabled for 90+ days before age 65 than to die before that age. Both risks need coverage — at the personal level and at the business level.',
      'The buy-sell agreement and the insurance policy funding it must be coordinated and updated as the business value changes. A policy sized to a 2015 business value protecting a 2026 business is dangerously underinsured.',

    overview: [
      'Most business owners hear "trust" and picture something their lawyer charges a lot of money to create for someone with a much larger estate than theirs. This is inaccurate. Trusts are legal structures that exist on a spectrum of complexity, and the simplest ones — the revocable living trust — are straightforwardly useful for almost any business owner with meaningful assets.',
      'The more important and overlooked question is not "do I need a trust?" but "what happens to my business interest if I am in a coma for six months?" The answer, without proper planning, is usually "very bad things." Trusts, combined with proper business succession documents, are the answer to that question.',
    ],
    concepts: [
      { term: 'Revocable Living Trust', def: 'You create the trust, transfer assets (including your business interest) into it, and serve as your own trustee during your lifetime. You retain full control and can revoke or amend the trust at any time. At death or incapacity, a successor trustee you named takes over seamlessly — without probate, without court supervision, without delay. For a business owner, this means the company keeps operating through the transition while the estate is sorted out.' },
      { term: 'Avoiding Probate', def: 'Assets that pass through your will must go through probate — a court-supervised process that is public, slow (often 12-24 months), and sometimes contentious. A business interest stuck in probate may lose customers, key employees, and value before control is transferred. A properly funded trust avoids probate entirely for the assets it holds, allowing immediate succession and continuity.' },
      { term: 'Irrevocable Trust for Asset Protection', def: 'An irrevocable trust, once created, cannot generally be changed by the grantor. In exchange for that loss of control, assets placed in the trust are no longer in the grantor\'s estate for tax purposes and may be protected from future creditors. Business owners in high-liability industries use these structures to remove valuable assets — real estate, investments, a holding company — from personal exposure. The rules vary significantly by state and structure, and the planning must precede the claim.' },
      { term: 'Holding Company Structure', def: 'A common protection strategy separates the operating business (which carries the liability of operations) from the valuable assets it uses — real estate, equipment, intellectual property, cash reserves — held in a separate LLC or holding company. The operating company leases these assets from the holding company. A lawsuit against the operating company cannot reach the assets held in the holding company. This structural separation is one of the most effective and underused liability management techniques for small businesses.' },
      { term: 'Irrevocable Life Insurance Trust (ILIT)', def: 'If a large life insurance death benefit would push your estate over the exemption threshold ($15,000,000 in 2026), an ILIT removes the policy from your taxable estate. The trust owns the policy, pays the premiums (funded by you through annual gifts), and receives the tax-free death benefit — which can then be used to fund estate taxes on other illiquid assets like a business without requiring a forced sale.' },
    ],
    keyTakeaways: [
      'A revocable living trust is not a complicated or exotic structure. For any business owner with more than modest assets, it is the baseline continuity document — more important than a will for business purposes.',
      'Holding company structures are one of the most effective asset protection strategies available to small businesses. They are also regularly foregone because owners find the idea of multiple entities confusing. The confusion is worth working through.',
      'Irrevocable structures are powerful but they require giving up control. They should be created deliberately, with clear goals, before you face a crisis — they are not effective when set up after a problem arises.',
      'The 2026 estate tax exemption of $15,000,000 per person (double for married couples with proper planning) means most business owners are not facing immediate estate tax exposure. This could change — the current elevated exemption is set to revert after 2025 without legislation.',

When an owner becomes incapacitated or dies without clear succession structure in place, the business faces simultaneous leadership vacuum, ownership confusion, potential lender acceleration, employee departures, and customer defections — all at once, while the people in charge of sorting it out are grieving.',
      'Estate planning for a business owner is fundamentally different from individual estate planning because the business itself is usually the largest and least liquid asset in the estate. That illiquidity creates a specific problem: estate taxes (if applicable) and estate administration costs must be paid in cash, but the cash may be locked inside a company that cannot be sold quickly without destroying its value.',

    concepts: [
      { term: 'The Four Succession Paths', def: '(1) Sale to a third party: the most common exit; maximizes price but requires finding a buyer, surviving due diligence, and a transition period. (2) Transfer to family: keeps the business in the family but requires planning for estate taxes, non-participating heirs, and usually the hardest professional conversations about whether family members are actually capable of running it. (3) Employee or management buyout (MBO): employees who know the business well buy it, often financed over time; preserves culture and employment. (4) Wind down: sometimes the right answer when the business depends entirely on the owner and has no transferable value without them.' },
      { term: 'Business Valuation', def: 'You cannot plan an estate around a number you are guessing at. A formal business valuation by a qualified business appraiser (CVA, ABV, or CBA credential) produces a defensible number for estate tax purposes, buy-sell agreement pricing, family transfer planning, and sale negotiations. Valuations typically use income, market, and asset approaches depending on the business type. For most small businesses, the income approach — a multiple of earnings — is primary.' },
      { term: 'Valuation Discounts for Gifting', def: 'When transferring minority interests in a business to family members or into trusts, legitimate valuation discounts for lack of control (minority discount) and lack of marketability may reduce the gift tax value of those interests by 20-40%. This means you can transfer more business value using your annual gift exclusion ($19,000 per recipient in 2026) and lifetime exemption ($15,000,000 in 2026) than the face value suggests.' },
      { term: 'Grantor Retained Annuity Trust (GRAT)', def: 'A GRAT is a trust to which you contribute business interests and receive an annuity back for a term of years. If the business appreciates faster than the IRS discount rate (the "hurdle rate"), that excess appreciation passes to heirs gift-tax free. GRATs are most effective for assets with high appreciation potential and are frequently used to transfer interests in growing businesses while the estate exemption remains elevated.' },
      { term: 'Buy-Sell Agreement as Estate Planning', def: 'A properly structured buy-sell agreement does triple duty: it protects co-owners during life, it funds the buyout of a deceased owner\'s estate so heirs get cash rather than an illiquid business interest, and it sets the estate tax value of the business interest — preventing the IRS from using a higher independent valuation. The agreement\'s pricing formula must be arm\'s-length and followed consistently to obtain the estate tax valuation benefit.' },
      { term: 'Creating Liquidity for Estate Taxes', def: `The federal estate tax exemption is $${(TAX_2026.estate.lifetimeExemption / 1e6).toFixed(0)}M per person in 2026, but it may drop significantly if current law expires. A business owner whose estate is primarily the business faces a forced sale scenario if they die without liquidity to pay estate taxes due within nine months. Life insurance owned through an ILIT, installment payments under IRC §6166 (available for qualified closely-held business interests), and the ESOP structure are the primary liquidity tools for this problem.` },

      'A buy-sell agreement is not just legal protection; it is a kindness to your co-owners, your employees, and your family. It removes the impossible conversation about price and control during the worst moment of everyone\'s lives.',
      'Family transfer planning works best when started early and executed gradually — not as a deathbed transaction. Early transfers capture lower valuations, lower gift tax values, and more time for appreciation to accumulate outside the estate.',
