A portfolio returning 15% with a Sharpe of 0.8 is actually worse than one returning 12% with a Sharpe of 1.6. The math tells a different story than the headline number.",

The formula is straightforward: subtract the risk-free rate (typically the 3-month Treasury yield) from the portfolio's return, then divide by the portfolio's standard deviation of returns. The result tells you how much excess return you're earning per unit of volatility. A higher number is always better." },

A portfolio that returns exactly 10% every year has a standard deviation near zero. A portfolio that returns 40%, then -20%, then 25%, then -5% also averages roughly 10% — but the ride is brutal. The Sharpe ratio penalizes that volatility, because volatility creates real-world problems: it forces investors to sell at lows, disrupts retirement income planning, and generates psychological stress that leads to poor decisions." },
      { type: 'p', text: "This is why the world's most sophisticated investors — endowments, pension funds, sovereign wealth funds — manage to Sharpe ratios rather than raw returns. The Yale Endowment under David Swensen famously maintained Sharpe ratios above 1.5 for decades, not by chasing the highest returns, but by combining uncorrelated asset classes to reduce portfolio volatility while maintaining strong returns." },
      { type: 'h2', text: 'The Limitations You Should Know' },
      { type: 'p', text: "The Sharpe ratio has real limitations. It treats upside and downside volatility identically — but most investors care far more about downside. A portfolio that frequently makes large gains but occasionally loses 5% gets penalized equally to one that makes modest gains but occasionally loses 30%. The Sortino ratio solves this by using downside deviation only, and is generally preferred for retirement income portfolios." },
      { type: 'p', text: "The Sharpe ratio also assumes returns are normally distributed, which they aren't. Equity returns have 'fat tails' — extreme events happen more often than a normal distribution predicts. Strategies that sell options or use leverage can appear to have very high Sharpe ratios right up until a catastrophic drawdown. This was a key structural failure in many hedge fund strategies leading into 2008." },
      { type: 'callout', text: "A Sharpe ratio above 1.0 means you're earning more than 1% of excess return for every 1% of annual volatility. Most retail investors, without realizing it, accept Sharpe ratios below 0.5 by holding undiversified portfolios in single accounts." },
      { type: 'h2', text: 'How to Apply This to Your Portfolio' },
      { type: 'p', text: "Most brokerage platforms do not calculate or display the Sharpe ratio. You'll need to calculate it yourself or use a portfolio analysis tool. To do so, download your monthly returns for the past 3 years, calculate the average annual return and the standard deviation of monthly returns (annualized by multiplying by √12), and apply the formula. The calculation takes 10 minutes in a spreadsheet and gives you a fundamentally different view of your portfolio's efficiency." },
      { type: 'p', text: "The goal isn't to maximize Sharpe in isolation. It's to make informed trade-offs. A higher-Sharpe portfolio may mean accepting a lower headline return. Whether that trade-off makes sense depends on your time horizon, income needs, and psychological tolerance for volatility. But you cannot make that trade-off consciously if you're only looking at returns." },
